Great rating/volume and price, but the title doesn\u2019t mention MagSafe; likely not magnetic. Best if you specifically want a clear, non-MagSafe case.\n- Miracase Magnetic for iPhone 16 Pro Case Full-Body Phone with Built-in Glass Screen Protector... \u2014 $16.95, 4.3 (108,070). Includes screen protector and MagSafe but has a meaningfully lower rating; full-body designs can feel bulky or affect screen feel.\n- OtterBox iPhone 16 Pro Commuter Series Case - Black \u2014 $49.99, 4.4 (472), \u201cOverall Pick.\u201d Premium protection but far pricier, smaller review pool here, and no explicit MagSafe ring mentioned.\n- SUPFINE Magnetic for iPhone 16 Pro Case... \u2014 $7.99, 4.5 (15,055), Sponsored.
